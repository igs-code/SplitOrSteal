# SplitOrSteal

**Split Or Steal** is a console application 2-player game. Each player provides their first name and then individually decides if they want to "split" or "steal." If both players choose "split" then they both get half of the prize. However, if one chooses "split" while the other chooses "steal," the player who stole gets the entire prize (and the other gets nothing). Unfortunately, if both players are greedy and both choose "steal" then they both lose!

## Getting Started

Build the application by running the command `make`

Run the application with the command: `./play`

Notes:

* Each player should only enter their first names
* The first player's choice is only "hidden" by using a lot of blank lines... technically, the second player can cheat by scrolling up
